Things to improve:
- crop (e.g. fixed zoom, edge detection, user by crop), and edit (e.g. white balance) incoming images, to extract lesion information only
- give advice on how to take image (e.g. camera mask)
- display pobability distribution for other classes
- tweek tflite model prediction parameters
- close tf model after longer inactivity
- overall design
- more/better info for diagnoses

One could add:
- account and login
- history of uploaded images
- api for health care providers
