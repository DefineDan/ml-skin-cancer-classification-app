Actinic keratoses (AKs) and Bowenâ€™s disease are common forms of sun-damage where abnormal cells have developed in the top layer of the skin (the epidermis) from excessive sun exposure. They appear as scaly patches. These usually occur on areas of the body which catch the sun such as the face and ears, scalp in balding men, back of the hands, forearms, and lower legs in women.
